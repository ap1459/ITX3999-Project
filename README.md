# ITX3999-Project

This repository is for my ITX3999 final project.

This repository includes -

* Project proposal
* Literature review
* Final project report
* OSCAR folder containing the project

Please note, due to size constraints, the "platforms" and "plugins" folder have not been included in this repo. They are default folders that come with making an app utilizing PhoneGap. If these are required, please refer to the appendix of my final report wherein it will discuss how to download and use PhoneGap with OSCAR.

Once completed, if you wish to make use of the "www" folder on here (which contains the relevant HTML, CSS and JavaScript), you can simply begin a new project with PhoneGap, then replace its default "www" folder with the one in this repo.
