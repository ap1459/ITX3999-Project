    <p>Tumblr came to be in 2007, founded by David Karp. It allows its users to post multimedia to what is 
        essentialy a blog. There existed over 375 million blogs as of November 2017. It is a useful platform 
        on which people can follow similiar people with similar interests, whether that be music, movies, and so on.
        Users can post images, video, text and "re-blog" content from other users Tubmlr blogs. As a platform it does 
        not filter content such as pornography that well, therefore it is entirely possible you may come across some it
        should be kept in mind.

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Unfortunately, Tumblr does not allow you to make your main blog private, instead if you want privacy,
            you can create a secondary blog with the same account, in which you are allowed to have a level of privacy.
            You can password protect this blog, which means that anyone who wants to access it, will need to know that specific
            password</li>
        <li>Tumblr does host sexually-explicit content, and if you have an account you can choose to hide said content
            if you do not want it appearing in search results.</li>
        <li>It is pretty easy and straightforward to "impluse" post on Tumblr, meaning you should take care and evaluate what you
            wish to post, as you do not want any negative ramifications</li>
