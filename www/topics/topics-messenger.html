    <p>For this section, we include both the online kind of instant messenger, which appear on Facebook, Twitter, etc but also
        messenger mobile applications such as Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber and Facebook Messenger. These are essentially forms of 
        instant and real time messages, usually short in length that are sent from one person to another, and in some cases a group
        of people can talk together in a chat group at the same time.

    <h5>Whatsapp Safety Tips</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Control who can see your information - this is in regard to your profile photo, last time you were online as well as 
            your status. This can be limited to only people who are in your address book, or to absolutely no one.</li>
        <li>Blocking - Whatsapp offers you the ability to block specific contacts from contacting you and seeing your profile.
            This can be achieved by going into Whatsapp settings, followed by Contacts, and then selecting who you wish to block.</li>
        <li>Think before you send - Take consideration when sharing messages, videos or images. Are they appropriate? Would you
            want other people to see them? Whatsapp itself does not store content, however this does not stop someone you are 
            sending content to, from saving it and sharing it they so please.
