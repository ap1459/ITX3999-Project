    <p>Twitter stands out in the social networking sphere as unlike its many counterparts, it only allows
        280 character 'Tweets' to be made by users, on contrast to say Facebook who has no such limit on comments. 
        Twitter came to be far back in 2006 by Jack Dorsey in July of that very year. It has been described as the "SMS of the internt".
        As of 2017, the service has 330 million users! The service also proved to be one of the places to get breaking news, especially 
        so in the case of the 2016 Presedential elections, with a staggering 40 million election-related tweets being created by
        10pm that very day!</p>

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Remember, unless your account is private, everyone can see what you tweet!</li>
        <li>Be wary or 3rd party apps! If one seems to have access to your account, you can "revoke access" in
            the settings.</li>
        <li>Don't "follow" anyone you don't know or trust, this can help to avoid spam and scammers</li>
        <li>Never tweet any personal or identifable information!</li>
        <li>Beware of bit.ly and http://t.co links! These may be tweeted by someone, or sent to you in 
            a direct message. These are shorthand links and you shouldn't click them unless you can verify you 
            were sent them legitametly, and not by a hacker!</li>
