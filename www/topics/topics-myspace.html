        * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
        * Disables use of eval() and inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
            * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

    <p>MySpace was launched in 2003 and spearheaded by Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe. It enjoyed huge popularity
        between the years of 2004 to 2009, and was the largest social network at that time! It even surpassed Google
        as the most visited site in the USA in 2006! Unfortunately for them, in 2009 they were surpassed by Facebook 
        in the number of unique visitors, and slowly became less and less popular. Despite this, the site still gets 50.6 million
        unique visists a month.</p>

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Information - You don't want to give away too much or unecessary information about yourself, only the bare
            minimum, as someone with malicious intent may use this against you</li>
        <li>Anonymity - Just because you may have decided to not use your realy name, it does not mean you are 
            anonymous! If are going to post pictures of yourself online, you must understand they are online indefinitely!</li>
        <li>Friends - Only accept the friend requests of people you know! You never know if someone online is who they
            actually say they are</li>
