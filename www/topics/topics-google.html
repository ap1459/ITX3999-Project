    <p>Google+ incorporates the many social media aspects we are familiar with, 
        such as sharing video/images, commenting, messaging and so on. The service was launced in June 2011
        and in 2016 was even considered a threat to Facebook by Mark Zucerkberg! Though it can be assumed this
        is no longer the case, as the platform only has 111 million active users as of 2015.</p>

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Unless you want anyone and everyone to see your friends and circles, you should restrict who can view this. 
            This can be done by going to "Profile and Privacy" and then going to "Edit Network Visibility", wherein you 
            can change the options regarding who can view your friends and circles.</li>
        <li>If you see a Globe icon next to anything in Google+, it means that that bit of information can be seen by anyone.
            This is important to take notice of, esepcially if there are things you'd rather keep private. In order to change
            this, it's advised you once again go to "Edit Network Visibility" and change it so it is not available to everyone</li>
        <li>Google+ offers the ability to change the visibility of whatever you post, just before you post it, therefore it will
            remember the the last setting of your previous post to automatically decide the visibiltiy of subsequent posts. Make 
            sure the setting is to how you like it before you post!a</li>
