    <p>Cyberbulling is a form of bullying that takes place online, be it on social media, through instant messengers
        , forums and so on. Any form of online space that offers communication between people can be a place
        where forms of cyberbullying take place. This kind of bullying can come in many forms, such as:</p>

    <ul id="cyberbullying-list">
        <li><span class="firstWord">Harrasment</span> - This is where one, or multiple people send rude, offensive or abusive messages to a person.
            They may also send this as comments on content someone has uploaded.</li>
        <li><span class="firstWord">Slander/Denigration</span> - When someone posts information online about another person, which is untrue, with a
            purpose of making them look bad and having an adverse effect on their reputation. This is typically in the 
            form of rumors and gossip.</li>
        <li><span class="firstWord">Trolling</span> - This is where someone will purposefully say something controversial or mean in an attempt to
            get another into an online argument, and it is done typically to get a reaction out of people and cause
            distress.</li>
    </ul>

    you can take to mitigate and finally stop any abuse you may be on the recieving end of:</p>

    <ul id="cyberbullying-list">
        <li><span class="firstWord">Tell someone</span> - You do not have to sit their in silence, reach out to the people in your life, be it parents,
            friends, your teacher, and even the police can offer you help and guidance in how best to proceed to deal with
            cyberbullying</li>
        <li><span class="firstWord">Reporting</span> - If someone is cyberbullinyg you on a social media platform, it is most likely the case that they are 
            going aginst the terms of service. Therefore you should use the available options to report them to the social network,
            whether it be Facebook, Twitter, and so on</li>
        <li><span class="firstWord">Ignore</span> - This method is best used when you are only recieving light name calling or such, as chances are the person is trying
           to troll you and get a reaction from you. It is suggested in these case to "not feed the trolls" and ignore their attempts
           to get a rise out of you</li>
