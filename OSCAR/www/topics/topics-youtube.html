    <p>YouTube was created back in 2005 by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen. YouTube is a platform which
        allows for people to view videos other people have uploaded, as well as a whole host of other functions if 
        you register an account, such as uploading videos, rating and commenting on other videos, and so on. Not only
        does the average Joe use YouTube, but many corporations and businesses, in an effort to promote themselves, ranging
        from music videos, TV shows, movie trailers, and much more. YouTube has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users, which
        is second only to Facebook! An astonishing 1 billion hours of YouTube is watched every single day!</p>

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>When deciding what content to upload, remember the "Grandma Rule". That is, only upload content you would be
            comfortable showing to your grandmother! Also consider if a future employer or coworker were to see it, if it
            would be deemed appropriate</li>
        <li>Be wary if you have your children using YouTube, they must be taught not to share/show any identifiable informtion,
            this could include school uniforms, the road that you live on, your numberplates on your car, and so on.</li>
        <li>Check YouTubes community guidelines to ensure what you upload is within their guidelines. If you recieve 3 
            strikes on your account, it will lead to you being banned!</li>
        <li>If you come across a video which is innapropriate, it can be flagged which will lead to a review by YouTube
            to determine if the content is indeed within their guidelines or not.</li>
