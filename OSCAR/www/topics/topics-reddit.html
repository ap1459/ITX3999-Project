    <p>Reddit was found in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, who were University of Virginia roommates. 
        Whilst not being a "true" form of social media still has many aspects that would put it broadly in to that 
        category. These include messaging, comments, discussion, and posting links/photos and videos. Whilst there is no "like"
        system similiar to Facebook, there is upvotes and downvotes, where users will upvote if they like the content, making it more
        likely to appear to others, and downvoting which is essentially the opposite. On here are whats known as "subreddits", which
        cover a myriad of different topics, ranging from computing, science, news, movies, fitness, video games, and so on. As of February
        2018, Reddit enjoys around 542 million monthly visitors!</p>
