        * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
        * Disables use of eval() and inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
            * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

    <p>Instagram is primarily a photo-based sharing service, allowing their users to share pictures and/or videos either
        to the public, or privately to chosen followers. Launched in 2010, by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger it was only
        available for iOS at first! Over the following years it became available for all platforms. As of September 2017, 
        it had over 800 million users worldwide!

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Unless you have a private account, everyone will be able to see the images you post, so make sure you
            are completely comfortable with what you are sharing and to a potential wide audience!</li>
        <li>If you decide on having your account private, anyone whose follow you accept will be able to see what 
            you post, therefore make sure you only accept people who you know and trust</li>
        <li>Don't set your profile name as youre real name, as a quick Google search of you real name could help
            someone malicious to identify you and find out personal information.</li>
        <li>Instagram offers the ability to filter comments based on specific keywords or default ones supplied
            by Instagram. Use this to stop people commenting things you do not want to see.</li>
        <li>Depending on what hashtags you include in your post, your posted image will show up in these tags, therefore
            make sure you are only including hashtags where you are happy for your image to show up</li>
