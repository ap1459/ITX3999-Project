        * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
        * Disables use of eval() and inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
            * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
            * Enable eval(): add 'unsafe-eval' to default-src

    <p>Snapchat was initially released back in 2011, created by Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown and Bobby Murphy
        What makes this service stand out from other messaging services, is that when a user sends a picture 
        or video another, they are only available to be viewed for a very short amount of time, after which 
        they can no longer be accessed and are discarded. Users can also update their "Story", which lasts 
        for 24 hours and may be a video or image, and this is a medium by which they can share content with 
        all their contacts at the same time. It currently enjoys a daily active user base of 187 million people!</p>

    <h5>Key Safety Points</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes Snapchat will recommed mutual friends to you, these should only be accepted if you
            know the person!</li>
        <li>Don't send anything innapropriate in a snap! You may trust your friends, but take into account
            that anyone could potentailly see the snap once it has been opened</li>
        <li>Only snap images/video to people you trust, as they may very well decide to screenshot it, even though
            Snapchat warns you this has happened, there isn't anything you can really do about it</li>
        <li>Never tweet any personal or identifable information!</li>
        <li>Beware of bit.ly and http://t.co links! These may be tweeted by someone, or sent to you in 
            a direct message. These are shorthand links and you shouldn't click them unless you can verify you 
            were sent them legitametly, and not by a hacker!</li>
