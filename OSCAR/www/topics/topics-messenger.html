    <p>For this section, when we say "messenger" this could apply to all forms of instant messenging services, such as Whatsapp and
        Facebook Messenger. These are able to send instant and real time messages, usually short in length and are sent 
        from one person to another, and in some cases a group of people can talk together in a chat group at the same time.</p>

    <h5>Whatsapp Safety Tips</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Control who can see your information - this is in regard to your profile photo, last time you were online as well as 
            your status. This can be limited to only people who are in your address book, or to absolutely no one.</li>
        <li>Blocking - Whatsapp offers you the ability to block specific contacts from contacting you and seeing your profile.
            This can be achieved by going into Whatsapp settings, followed by Contacts, and then selecting who you wish to block.</li>
        <li>Think before you send - Take consideration when sharing messages, videos or images. Are they appropriate? Would you
            want other people to see them? Whatsapp itself does not store content, however this does not stop someone you are 
            sending content to, from saving it and sharing it if they so please.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Facebook Messenger Safety Tips</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Be cautious of messages that are brief or somewhat cryptic. These more often than not can be links to dangerous websites
            that can download malicious content to your computer. If you recieve a message like this from a friend, do not click the 
            link and message them back to let them know this has occured. If you recieve a message like this from someone you don't know,
            don't reply!</li>
